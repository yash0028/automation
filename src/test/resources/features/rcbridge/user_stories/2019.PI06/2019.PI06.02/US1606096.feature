  Scenario: TC742473 - [RL0]
    Given a list of global groups is available
    Then a developer will create documentation to map those global groups and their access within the CMD.
    #Given this user story is complete AND
    #when we will have a list of user roles (mapped to windows platform groups) and can provide the information to the application owner to create an RBAC document for the CMD app, that will ultimately be used by Secure.
    #then the roles can be defined into the CMD application to provide separate and distinct access at the user role level.
