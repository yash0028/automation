  Scenario: TC564704 - [RL0]
    Given I am logged into Exari as a Contract Administrator,
    When I apply the defined User Group configurations and select save,
    Then the Exari application will be configured with the appropriate User Group configurations, to support the overall user access and security model structure, which will meet the Contract, Entity, and Workflow user business needs.
